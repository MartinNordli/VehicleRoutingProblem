Standard:
Mutation_rate = 0.2         // 0.2 seems like a sweet spot
Mutation_rate_after = 0.8   // 08 worked well

Population_size = 4000      // Good results on test data, but could try to up it.
Generations = ~5000         // Change if it stagnates early, but doesnÂ´t matter because of ctr + c
Max_no_improvement = 250    // Good as is, but can adjust
Max_iterations = 100        // Keep the same
